# Ranner: *The Trip Planner*

 ----

*Ranner* empowers users to easily plan and manage every detail of their travel plans. This means balancing information with simplicity. Users are given an experience that enables them to consider the numerous variables of traveling, while also being able to expeditiously move forward with their planning. Too much information can bog a user down and make planning an overwhelming experience, but too little information could lead to a disastrous trip. *Ranner* has the enabling balance for great trip planning!

### Amadeus Travel API
*Ranner* utilizes the *Amadeus Travel API* for the most current and comprehensive travel data. Currently, *Ranner* gets flight, airport, and city data from *Amadeus*, because of *Ranner*'s focus on a simplistic experience, but *Amadeus* has a wealth of information--everything from city accomodations to rental cars, and even the probability of a flight to be on time, based on the routes history. 
"Amadeus provides a rich set of APIs for the travel industry."
You can explore the *Amadeus API* at the link to the docs below. They also offers an SDK which is what *Ranner* utilizes.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
